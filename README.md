# Coup

## The card game Coup programmed functionally in Clojure

### Project description

We&#39;re making the card game Coup digital. Coup is a turn-based card game that blends strategy and bluffing. Our project will let players play Coup with each other over the internet. One of the biggest reasons you may be interested in joining my project is because we&#39;ll be doing the coding in a functional style with Clojure.

### Team

I&#39;m looking for one person to join my team.

### SQL

The current plan is to use PostgreSQL. SQLite is another option.

### No-SQL

I&#39;m leaning towards using Crux, a schemaless immutable document database.

### Business

Our application will be free to play. If we eventually decided to distribute it, we&#39;d need to get permission from the Coup copyright holders.

### Legal

We&#39;d need permission from the Coup copyright holders before we could form any kind of legal entity or license the application.

### Technical

Details:

- We&#39;ll do the project with a functional programming style in Clojure
- The front-end will be a simple command line interface
- We&#39;ll host the backend and database using a Digital Ocean droplet
- We&#39;ll code the frontend and backend simultaneously by doing one piece of functionality at a time

Plans:

1. Design the SQL database schema
2. Make account registration and login functionality
3. Make game hosting/joining functionality
4. Make actual game play functionality
5. Migrate project to a No-SQL database
6. If we have time, we could also implement the Reformation expansion to Coup
