To run:
$ clojure -m coup.core


MVP Process:
    1. current-turn-player submits action
    2. action is processed and turn increments

If action is invalid in any way (i.e. not enough coins, targets dead player),
    then turn does not increment, re-prompt for new action.


Front end will handle action blocking (eventually)

Simplified rules:
    When the current-turn-player does an action, anyone may challenge
    When a targeted player protects self, only current-turn-player may challenge

Process:
    1. current-turn-player submits action
    2. if action targets player:
        a. targeted-player may block
        b. current-turn-player may challenge
    2. another player submits reaction (if any)
    3. current-turn-player may:
        a. reveal incorrect card (or neither):
            Current-turn-player loses influence card
        b. reveal correct card
            Challenging player loses influence card
