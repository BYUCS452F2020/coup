I want to help with this project because I want to learn more about making online games, as well as learn more about Clojure. I have built a REST api in Clojure, so I will be able to contribue a lot on the back end. In addition, I built a PostgreSQL database for that API.

Business: Coup will be free to play. We'll be deploying on a Digital Ocean Droplet to keep operating costs low.

Legal: As long as we don't monetize, we shouldn't have any copyright issues with the creators of Coup.

Technical: We will be deploying over Digital Ocean. The back-end and front-end will be in Clojure. The SQL database will be in PostgreSQL. Our NoSQL database will be an immutable database (like Crux or Datomic).
